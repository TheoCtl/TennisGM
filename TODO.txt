SURVEILLER PROGRESSION

-- FIXES --



-- FEATURES --

player details :
  -> year-to-year ranking prog graph on right of screen thanks to year start ranking.

bracket : 
   number in parenthesis = rank among tournament participants instead of global rank
   clickable name -> tooltip box (player rank, ELO, age, archetype, number of times he won tournament)

player stats blocks when visualising match :
   -> possibility to switch tabs -> player stats/match stats
   -> match stats = aces, breaks, forehand/backhand/special winners

mental stat (and add it to the visualisation player stats blocks) :
   -> when at least one of the players has at least 5 points in the current set, the 
   player with the highest rated "mental" has a *1.02 rating boost to his stats

ADD NEW ARCHETYPES

change behavior of dropshots/volleys to add more variation and strategy. 
   -> Now if a player does a volley, he is in volley mode until the end of the point 
   (only does volleys). Volleys values and coordinates are calculated like normal shots 
   instead of like dropshots.
   -> If a player catches an opponent's dropshot, he's now in volley mode until the
   end of the point.
   -> find a way in visualisation to show a player is at the net.
This means if a player has good volley stats, he should use it to go to the net to 
finish the points more efficiently than a player with low stats. Also if a player
with a good dropshot faces a player with bad volley, he can use the dropshot to make
the opponent advance to the net, where his bad volley will make him loose the point.
