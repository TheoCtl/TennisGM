# Enhanced TennisGM Tab System - Individual Records & Tournament Round Tabs

## New Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Individual Record Tabs in Achievements ðŸ“Š

**Previous Design**: Category-based tabs (Tournament Wins, Match Wins, Rankings)
**New Design**: Individual tab for each specific record type

#### Features:
- **Individual Record Tabs**: Each record gets its own tab (e.g., "Most Tournament Wins", "Most Grand Slam Wins", "Most Matches Won on Clay")
- **Direct Ranking Display**: Click a tab to immediately see the Top 10 ranking for that specific record
- **Scrollable Tab Bar**: Horizontal scrolling for many record tabs
- **Smart Record Display**: Context-aware formatting based on record type:
  - Tournament records show tournament counts
  - Match records show match counts with surface info
  - Ranking records show weeks at position

#### Technical Implementation:
```python
# Scrollable tab frame for multiple record tabs
tab_canvas = tk.Canvas(tab_frame, height=40)
tab_scrollbar = tk.Scrollbar(tab_frame, orient="horizontal", command=tab_canvas.xview)

# Individual tabs for each record
for title in sorted(record_map.keys()):
    btn = tk.Button(scrollable_tab_frame, text=title, bg=color, 
                  command=lambda t=title: self.switch_achievements_tab(t))

# Direct ranking display method
def _display_record_ranking(self, parent_frame, record):
    # Shows Top 10 directly without additional clicks
```

### 2. Tournament Bracket Round-Based Navigation ðŸŽ¾

**Previous Design**: Single view showing entire tournament bracket
**New Design**: Tab-based round filtering with intelligent round naming

#### Features:
- **Round-Specific Tabs**: View bracket starting from any round (e.g., "Semifinals", "Final")
- **Intelligent Round Naming**: Automatic naming based on tournament size:
  - 7 rounds: "Round of 128" â†’ "Round of 64" â†’ ... â†’ "Final"  
  - 4 rounds: "Round of 16" â†’ "Quarterfinals" â†’ "Semifinals" â†’ "Final"
  - 2 rounds: "Semifinals" â†’ "Final"
- **Full Bracket Option**: "Full Bracket" tab to see entire tournament
- **Preserved Functionality**: All simulation and watch buttons work correctly
- **Visual Consistency**: Same bracket styling with filtered view

#### Round Naming Logic:
```python
def _get_round_names(self, num_rounds):
    if num_rounds == 4:
        return ["Round of 16", "Quarterfinals", "Semifinals", "Final"]
    elif num_rounds == 7:
        return ["Round of 128", "Round of 64", "Round of 32", "Round of 16", 
                "Quarterfinals", "Semifinals", "Final"]
    # ... handles all tournament sizes
```

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Round Filtering**: `rounds_to_show = bracket[start_round:]`
- **Position Calculation**: Adjusts match positioning for filtered rounds
- **Button Preservation**: Simulate/Watch buttons work on filtered views
- **Tab Switching**: `switch_bracket_tab(tab, tournament)` maintains state
