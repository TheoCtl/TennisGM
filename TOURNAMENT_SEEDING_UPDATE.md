# Tournament Seeding System Update

## Overview
The tournament seeding system has been updated to create more competitive and interesting first-round matchups by implementing a **hybrid seeding approach**.

## New Seeding System

### **Core Concept:**
- **Top Half**: Seeds 1 through (draw_size/2) are seeded normally
- **Bottom Half**: Players ranked (draw_size/2 + 1) through draw_size are **randomly shuffled**
- **Pairing**: Each top seed plays against a randomly assigned bottom half player

### **Example - 32 Player Tournament:**

#### **Old System (Traditional Seeding):**
```
#1 vs #32    #9  vs #24
#2 vs #31    #10 vs #23  
#3 vs #30    #11 vs #22
#4 vs #29    #12 vs #21
#5 vs #28    #13 vs #20
#6 vs #27    #14 vs #19
#7 vs #26    #15 vs #18
#8 vs #25    #16 vs #17
```

#### **New System (Hybrid Seeding):**
```
Top Seeds (1-16) vs Random Bottom Half (17-32)
#1 vs #25    #9  vs #24
#2 vs #17    #10 vs #31  
#3 vs #19    #11 vs #28
#4 vs #27    #12 vs #32
#5 vs #23    #13 vs #21
#6 vs #18    #14 vs #22
#7 vs #20    #15 vs #30
#8 vs #29    #16 vs #26
```

## Benefits

### **More Competitive First Rounds:**
- **Old**: #1 vs #32 (almost guaranteed win)
- **New**: #1 vs #25 (still favored, but more competitive)

### **Increased Upset Potential:**
- Players like #17-20 can face higher seeds earlier
- Creates more exciting storylines and unpredictable outcomes
- Better matches for spectators/simulation

### **Balanced Tournament Structure:**
- Top seeds still protected from meeting each other early
- Maintains tournament bracket integrity
- Preserves seeding advantages for the best players

## Technical Implementation

### **Code Location:** `src/schedule.py` - `generate_bracket()` method

### **Key Changes:**
```python
# Old system
pairs = []
for i in range(draw_size // 2):
    p1 = sorted_ids[i]            # i-th best
    p2 = sorted_ids[-(i + 1)]     # i-th worst
    pairs.append((p1, p2))

# New system  
half_draw = draw_size // 2
top_half = sorted_ids[:half_draw]      # Top seeds
bottom_half = sorted_ids[half_draw:]   # Bottom half
random.shuffle(bottom_half)            # Randomize bottom half

pairs = []
for i in range(half_draw):
    p_top = top_half[i]           # i-th best seeded player
    p_bottom = bottom_half[i]     # randomly assigned bottom half player
    pairs.append((p_top, p_bottom))
```

## Tournament Size Examples

### **16 Players:**
- **Seeded**: #1-8
- **Random**: #9-16 (shuffled)
- **Result**: More competitive than #1 vs #16, #2 vs #15, etc.

### **64 Players:**
- **Seeded**: #1-32  
- **Random**: #33-64 (shuffled)
- **Result**: Top players face mid-tier opponents instead of complete unknowns

### **8 Players:**
- **Seeded**: #1-4
- **Random**: #5-8 (shuffled) 
- **Result**: Even small tournaments get more interesting matchups

## Impact on Tournament Dynamics

### **Strategic Implications:**
1. **Rankings Matter More**: Being in top half guarantees seeded position
2. **Mid-Tier Competition**: Players ranked 17-32 have better chances for upsets
3. **Viewer Interest**: More competitive first round matches
4. **Realistic Simulation**: Mirrors real tennis where surprises happen

### **Maintains Tennis Tradition:**
- Top seeds still separated in different quarters
- Bracket structure unchanged
- Seeding principles preserved for elite players
- Only randomizes the "should-win" matchups

## Comparison Analysis

| Aspect | Old System | New System |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Top Seed Protection** | Maximum | Maintained |
| **First Round Competitiveness** | Low | Higher |
| **Upset Potential** | Minimal | Increased |
| **Tournament Unpredictability** | Low | Higher |
| **Seeding Advantages** | Full | Preserved for top half |
| **Viewer Interest** | Predictable | More exciting |

## Example Scenarios

### **Potential Exciting Matchups:**
- **#1 vs #17**: Former top-10 player with injury comeback
- **#3 vs #18**: Rising young player vs established veteran  
- **#8 vs #19**: Two similar-level players in competitive match
- **#12 vs #20**: Mid-tier battle instead of #12 vs #21 (predictable)

### **Upset Opportunities:**
- A #18-ranked player could upset #2 in first round
- Creates storylines: "Unseeded player defeats former world #2"
- More realistic simulation of real tournament dynamics
